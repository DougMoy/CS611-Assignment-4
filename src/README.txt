Any Board game of this type where players roam around the world would use these.

## Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. This program relies on ANSI escape characters to add background
    and foreground color. If your terminal does not support this, the game
    will look misaligned.
2. This project makes changes to many of the mechanics of the game.
    Please read the readme fully to get an idea of what has changed.

1. Navigate to the directory where all the .txt files and .java files are held
2. Run the following instructions:
javac *.java
java Main

## Bonuses for Original Project
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Color coded
    Colored components have been added to the game
2. Spell range buff
    Spells can be cast on monsters 2 tiles away. This is to demonstrate the
    extensibility of the code, as well as add another layer of strategy to
    the game, as now inter-lane positioning is important to attack other
    lanes.
3. Row extension
    The number of rows of the board (i.e. the distance from one nexus to the other) can be changed or shortened.
4. Epic Visuals
    Title screen is very engaging and draws users in. Users will be surely hooked by the colors and graphics.

        ...
        <List of every hero>

Before the LoV (Legends of Valor) game starts, the player needs to select their 3 heroes.
Entering the number listed on the left of each hero will select them.

        How many rows would you like your map to have?

After hero selection, the game will ask you for how many rows the map will have. The higher the number you answer,
the further away the hero and monster nexus will be. 8 rows will give a square board.
